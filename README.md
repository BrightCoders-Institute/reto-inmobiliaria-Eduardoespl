## Description
This is a real state app that allows the clients to see the properties that are available for rent or sale. The clients can also see the details of the properties and contact the real state agency to get more information about the properties. Some details of the properties are: name, location, number of rooms, number of bathrooms, surface, price per month, rate and an icon that allows the user to mark the property as favorite.
